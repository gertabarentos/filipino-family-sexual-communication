# Exploring the Determinants of Filipino Family Sexual Communication in among Quezon City Youth
This journal explores the social determinants of Filipino Family Sexual Communication using an internet survey data done in 2021. Family Sexual Communication is measured by the frequency, content, and quality of discussing sexual topics between parents and their child(ren). 

## Rationale:
Previous studies have shown that poor family sexual communication contributes to a youth’s negative sexual outcomes, such as unsafe sexual practices, early sexual engagement, lower partner sexual communication, and sexual self-efficacy. In the Philippines, where conservative values on sex are shared, the examination of contributing factors to the extent and messaging of family sexual communication has not been adequately explored. We sought to fill this gap by examining sociodemographic factors that predict communication of sexual topics—those relating to risk, pleasure, and perceived sensitive ones, between youth from Quezon city and their families. 

Specifically, the objectives of the study are:
1.	To know the sociodemographic profile of the respondents,
2.	To determine the extent of family sexual communication of the respondents, and 
3.	To find out the sociodemographic determinants of Filipino family sexual communication.
